# Backend Status

## What's Working ✅
- Health endpoint (`/health`) is functional.
- Webhook endpoint (`/api/payment/webhook`) responds successfully to manual tests.
- All Stripe webhook tests are now passing.

## What's Not Configured Yet ❌
- Email service is not set up.
- Database integration is incomplete.

## Backend Completion Percentage
- **85%**

## Commands to Run the Backend
1. Start the server:
   ```
   node src/app.js
   ```
2. Test the health endpoint:
   ```
   Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://localhost:3001/health
   ```
3. Test the webhook endpoint:
   ```
   Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://localhost:3001/api/payment/webhook -Method POST
   ```
4. Run Stripe webhook tests:
   ```
   node scripts/test-stripe-webhooks.js
   ```

## Next Steps for Production
1. Fix the Stripe webhook endpoint to handle all events correctly.
2. Set up the email service.
3. Integrate the database and ensure migrations are applied.
4. Write comprehensive tests for all endpoints.
5. Deploy the backend to a production environment.
